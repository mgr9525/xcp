# xcp: An extended cp

`xcp` is a (partial) clone of the Unix `cp` command. It is not intended as a
full replacement, but as a companion utility with some more user-friendly
feedback and some optimisations that make sense under certain tasks (see
below).

*Warning*: `xcp` is currently beta-level software and almost certainly contains
bugs and unexpected or inconsistent behaviour. It probably shouldn't be used for
anything critical yet.

Additionally, there are some known issues with copying files from virtual
filesystems (e.g. `/proc`, `/sys`), especially when using the block-parallel
('parblock') driver. See [this LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/846403/)
for an overview of some of the complexities of dealing with kernel-generated
files. There are some preliminary tests for this failing functionality on the
branch [issue24-add-tests-for-virtual-files](https://github.com/tarka/xcp/tree/issue24-add-tests-for-virtual-files).

## Installation

*NOTE*: `xcp` requires Rust 1.64 (2021 edition) or higher.

### Cargo

`xcp` can be installed directly from `crates.io` with:
```
cargo install xcp
```

### Arch Linux

[`xcp`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xcp/) is available on the Arch Linux User Repository. If you use an AUR helper, you can execute a command such as this:
```
yay -S xcp
```

### NetBSD
[`xcp`](https://pkgsrc.se/sysutils/xcp) is available on NetBSD from the official repositories. To install it, simply run:
```
pkgin install xcp
```

## Features and Anti-Features

### Features

* Displays a progress-bar, both for directory and single file copies. This can
  be disabled with `--no-progress`.
* On Linux it uses `copy_file_range` call to copy files. This is the most
  efficient method of file-copying under Linux; in particular it is
  filesystem-aware, and can massively speed-up copies on network mounts by
  performing the copy operations server-side. However, unlike `copy_file_range`
  sparse files are detected and handled appropriately.
* Optimised for 'modern' systems (i.e. multiple cores, copious RAM, and
  solid-state disks, especially ones connected into the main system bus,
  e.g. NVMe).
* Optional aggressive parallelism for systems with parallel IO. Quick
  experiments on a modern laptop suggest there may be benefits to parallel
  copies on NVMe disks. This is obviously highly system-dependent.
* Switchable 'drivers' to facilitate experimenting with alternative strategies
  for copy optimisation. Currently 2 drivers are available:
  * 'parfile': the previous hard-coded xcp copy method, which parallelises
    tree-walking and per-file copying. This is the default.
  * 'parblock': An experimental driver that parallelises copying at the block
    level. This has the potential for performance improvements in some
    architectures, but increases complexity. Currently MacOS is not
    supported. Testing is welcome.
* Non-Linux Unix-like OSs (OS X, *BSD) are supported via fall-back operation
  (although sparse-files are not yet supported in this case).
* Optionally understands `.gitignore` files to limit the copied directories.
* Optional native file-globbing.

### (Possible) future features

* Conversion of files to sparse where appropriate, as with `cp`'s
  `--sparse=always` flag.
* Aggressive sparseness detection with `lseek`.

### Anti-Features

* On Linux `copy_file_range()` requires a kernel version of 4.5 and onwards; if
  it is missing `xcp` will fall-back to user-space copy.
* On non-Linux OSs sparse-files are not supported (although could be added if
  supported by the OS).
* Assumes a 'modern' system with lots of RAM and fast, solid-state disks. In
  particular it is likely to thrash on spinning disks as it attempts to gather
  metadata and perform copies at the same time.
* Currently missing a lot of `cp`'s features and flags, although these could be
  added.

## Performance

Benchmarks are mostly meaningless, but to check we're not introducing _too_ much
overhead for local copies, the following are results from a laptop with an NVMe
disk and in single-user mode. The target copy directory is a git checkout of the
Firefox codebase, having been recently gc'd (i.e. a single 4.1GB pack
file). `fstrim -va` is run before each test run to minimise SSD allocation
performance interference.

### Local copy

* Single 4.1GB file copy, with the kernel cache dropped each run:
    * `cp`: ~6.2s
    * `xcp`: ~4.2s
* Single 4.1GB file copy, warmed cache (3 runs each):
    * `cp`: ~1.85s
    * `xcp`: ~1.7s
* Directory copy, kernel cache dropped each run:
    * `cp`: ~48s
    * `xcp`: ~56s
* Directory copy, warmed cache (3 runs each):
    * `cp`: ~6.9s
    * `xcp`: ~7.4s

### NFS copy

`xcp` uses `copy_file_range`, which is filesystem aware. On NFSv4 this will result
in the copy occurring server-side rather than transferring across the network. For
large files this can be a significant win:

* Single 4.1GB file on NFSv4 mount
    * `cp`: 378s
    * `xcp`: ~37s
